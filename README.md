# Undergraduate Storage
This is a repo with most of the code I have written across my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science. Touching on a wide range of languages, from Python to C#, MATLAB to C++, this serves as a better way to store my program files as I clear out other cloud storage. Despite the language diversity, the repo is segregated by year, not language. This is for cloud storage purposes only, as I have deemed Google Drive not adequate for storing code (read: I want to be able to read my work nicely). In each section there *should be* an about, which will detail contents of each section as far as can be remembered

The bar to the right indicating language percentage is not indicative of time spent, as many C++ files were included for functionality purposes and never edited. When going by time, the two most used languages are C# and Python.
