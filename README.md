# UnderGradStorage
This is a repo with most of the code I have written across my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science. Touching on a wide range of languages, from Python to C#, MATLAB to C++, this serves as a better way to store my program files as I clear out other cloud storage. Despite the language diversity, the repo is segregated by year, not language. This is for storage purposes only. Only original or heavily edited code is here
