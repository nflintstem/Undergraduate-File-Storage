# About
In this folder are code files for first year. I only did programming in Programming Fundamentals and Object Oriented.

The first assignment required us to implement the D'Hondt election system and apply it to the European Parliament. There was a presentation performed here.
The next asked to implement a card game known as Lincoln. Similar to that "21" game we played as children.
